Project Overview

Astrida AI is an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework built using JavaScript. It leverages a variety of machine learning concepts and advanced techniques to demonstrate the potential of intelligent systems. Astrida AI is designed to evolve over time, learning from various data inputs and optimizing its decision-making capabilities. Through this project, you will explore key concepts like neural networks, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and advanced optimization algorithms, all of which contribute to the development of a more autonomous and capable AI system.

Astrida AI is still in its early stages, but it is structured to be easily extendable and scalable for future improvements. The current implementation is focused on demonstrating basic machine learning models and training loops, with a focus on potential future applications, such as robotics, self-learning systems, and real-time feedback processing.
Features

    Neural Network Training: Astrida AI implements a basic neural network that can learn through backpropagation, using techniques like Adam optimization.
    Reinforcement Learning: Implements a learning loop where Astrida makes decisions based on its environment and adapts to improve its behavior over time.
    Advanced Optimizers: Includes state-of-the-art optimizers like Adam, used to train the neural network efficiently.
    Loss Functions & Evaluation: The AI uses various loss functions to evaluate its performance and adjust the model accordingly.
    Backpropagation & Gradients: The model uses backpropagation to minimize loss by updating the weights of its layers using computed gradients.
    Scalability: Astrida AI is built with scalability in mind, enabling easy integration of additional layers, algorithms, and techniques to enhance its capabilities.

Key Components

    Neural Network: The main class responsible for managing the neural network architecture, including layers, activations, and optimization.
    Dense Layer: Implements a fully connected layer for the neural network, applying weights and biases.
    Activation Functions: Implements various activation functions such as ReLU, Sigmoid, and Softmax for each layer.
    Optimizer: An advanced optimizer for adjusting weights during training.
    Training Loop: Simulates training of the neural network on tasks like the XOR problem, with loss evaluation and backpropagation.
    Reinforcement Learning: A module implementing reinforcement learning techniques to adapt Astrida’s behavior based on interaction with its environment.

Requirements

    JavaScript/ES6: The code is written in modern JavaScript (ES6), leveraging classes, promises, and other advanced JavaScript features.
    Web Browser: You can run Astrida AI in any modern web browser. Simply include the relevant JavaScript files in an HTML document, or run the code directly in the browser’s developer console.

Setup Instructions

To get started with Astrida AI, follow these simple steps:

    Clone the Repository:
    Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.

    Run in a Browser:
        Open the astrida.xyz site in your browser.
        Alternatively, you can paste the code directly into your browser's developer tools console to execute it.

    Start Training:
    Once the AI is set up, you can begin training by calling the train() method in the console, passing in the relevant training data and targets. The neural network will begin training, displaying the loss for each epoch.

    Evaluate the AI:
    After training, you can test the model by using it to predict new data points. Astrida will process the input and provide an output based on the learned parameters.

Example Usage

const trainingData = [
    [0, 0],  // XOR inputs
    [0, 1],
    [1, 0],
    [1, 1]
];

const targets = [
    [0],  // XOR outputs
    [1],
    [1],
    [0]
];

// Create a new Neural Network
const astridaNetwork = new NeuralNetwork([
    new DenseLayer(2, 4),  // Input layer with 2 neurons and hidden layer with 4 neurons
    new ReLUActivation(),
    new DenseLayer(4, 1),  // Output layer with 1 neuron
    new SigmoidActivation()
]);

// Train the model
astridaNetwork.train(trainingData, targets, 100);

Future Directions

    Expanded Learning Models: Astrida AI can evolve further by integrating additional learning algorithms, such as deep reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and transfer learning.
    Natural Language Processing (NLP): Future versions may incorporate NLP capabilities, allowing Astrida to understand and generate human language.
    Robotics Integration: We aim to eventually integrate Astrida into robotic systems, enabling it to perceive and interact with its environment in real-time.
    Self-Improvement: In future versions, Astrida will have the ability to self-optimize, improve upon its existing models, and potentially even generate new models.
